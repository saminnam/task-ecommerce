## Animations

This project incorporates a variety of animations to deliver an engaging and dynamic user experience:

- **Toast Notifications**: Used to provide real-time feedback, such as when a product is added to the cart, with smooth fade-in and fade-out effects.
- **Keyframes**: Custom CSS keyframe animations are implemented to create unique and visually appealing transitions and interactions.
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: Enhances the scrolling experience by adding smooth animations to elements as they appear in the viewport.
- **Expertise in Unique UI Animations**: I have extensive knowledge of implementing a wide range of animation techniques and UI patterns, enabling me to create unique and tailored user experiences.

These animations not only improve functionality but also make the website visually captivating and user-friendly.
